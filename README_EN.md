## Introduction

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.md) | English

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chipeak_data_tool is an open source toolbox based on the data sets generated by various artificial intelligence annotation tools and the data sets generated by the deep learning image annotation tool labelme.The main branch code currently supports the mutual conversion of coco dataset and labelme dataset.


## Major features

- **Modular Design**

  Various data sets are decoupled into different module components. By combining different module components, users can easily build custom data set processing.

## Installation

pip install cpdt

## Getting Started

Please see [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for the basic usage of chipeak_cv_data_tool.
