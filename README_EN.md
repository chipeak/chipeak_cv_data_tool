## Introduction

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.md) | English

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chipeak_ cv_ data_ tool is mainly used for the conversion between various data sets (computer vision) formats, such as coco, label me, etc. In addition, it also integrates common processing functions of data, files, videos and other files.


## Major features

- **Modular Design**

  Various data sets are decoupled into different module components. By combining different module components, users can easily build custom data set processing.

## Installation

pip install cpdt

## Getting Started

Please see [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for the basic usage of chipeak_cv_data_tool.
